# 🎨 Color Assist App

An Android application designed to **assist color-blind users** by making color-dependent information easier to see, understand, and interpret.

Instead of real-time camera detection, this app focuses on **uploaded images, charts, documents, and test strips**, adapting results based on different types of color blindness.

## 🧠 What Problem Does This Solve?

Many everyday things rely heavily on color:
- charts and graphs
- test strips (pH, nitrate, ammonia, etc.)
- emails or documents with confusing color highlights

For users with color vision deficiencies, this information can become unclear or misleading.  
**Color Assist App bridges that gap.**

## ✨ Key Features

### 🖼️ Image-Based Color Detection
- Upload an image from the gallery
- Tap/select a **specific region**
- Get clear color identification in readable terms

### 📊 Color-Coded Chart Conversion
- Converts color-based charts and graphs
- Adapts output based on the **user’s type of color blindness**
- Presents data in text or alternative visual formats

### 📧 OCR for Emails & Documents
- Extracts text from images or screenshots
- Reduces confusion caused by color-highlighted text
- Improves readability for color-blind users

### 🧪 Test Strip Level Identification
Supports interpretation of color-based tests such as:
- pH scale
- Nitrate levels
- Ammonia levels
- Similar chemical or diagnostic strips

Results are converted into **clear numeric or labeled values** instead of raw colors.

## 👁️ Supported Color Vision Types

- Protanopia
- Deuteranopia
- Tritanopia
- General color vision deficiency modes

*(Can be expanded as the project evolves)*
